- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jib Ray, a partner at Interwoof. I do both hardware and software design.
The hardware designs I have done recently have included digital and analog.
I have recent experience with C, C++, Python and Swift, but have worked in many other
languages over my career.

I can be reached at jib2ray.gmail.com or jib@interwoof.com.
